File synchronization


Copy keeping file metadata (user, permissions...):

    rsync -a source/ dest/

Delete files in destination which are not in the source:

    rsync --delete src dst

Exclude certain directories:

    rsync --exclude '.*' --exclude 'dir' src dst

Show overall percentage (good when many recursive files):

    # Install brew rsync first
    brew tap homebrew/dupes; brew install rsync
    
    rsync -a --info=progress2 source/ dest/
