Netcat: amazing TCP/UDP tool

`ncat` is a modern version of this.

Scan open ports:

    nc -zv <host> 80
    nc -zv <host> 22 80 8080
    nc -zv <host> 20-30

Use manyally a HTTP connection (like `telnet`):

    $ nc www.google.com 80 # Write manually the next lines
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.google.com
    
    [response...]

Compress a file and send it to the network:

    tar cfp - /some/dir | gzip -c | nc -w 3 othermachine 1234
